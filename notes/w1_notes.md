  Use a visual-based approach instead of metadata features (these methods fail if attackers use images or embedded objects instead of HTML text. They are also vulnerable to code obfuscation techniques where a differentcode produces similar rendered images). Motivated by these reasons, we treated the problem as a similar-ity learning problem with deep learning using Siamese or tripletnetworks which have been successfully used in applications such as face verification, signature verification, and character recognition. In each of these applications, the identity of an image is compared against a database and the model verifies if this identity is matched with any of those in the database.

  SLR of 80 recent works. The survey revealed that while gathering the data sets, researchers primarily accessed two sources: 53 studies accessed the PhishTank website (53 for the phishing data set) and 29 studies used Alexa's website for downloading legitimate data sets. Also, as per the literature survey, most studies used Machine Learning techniques; 31 used Random Forest Classifier. Finally, as per different studies, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) achieved the highest Accuracy, 99.98%, for detecting phishing websites.
